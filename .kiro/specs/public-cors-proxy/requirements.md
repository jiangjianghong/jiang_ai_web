# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to migrate the current CORS proxy functionality from Vercel and Supabase to a public free proxy service, ensuring the application works correctly when deployed to GitHub Pages. The current implementation relies on Vercel serverless functions and Supabase Edge Functions, which are not compatible with GitHub Pages hosting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace the Vercel and Supabase CORS proxy functionality with a public free proxy service, so that the application works correctly when deployed to GitHub Pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed to GitHub Pages THEN all API requests that previously used Vercel or Supabase CORS proxy SHALL work correctly.
2. WHEN making requests to external APIs (especially Notion API) THEN the application SHALL use a reliable public CORS proxy service.
3. WHEN the application needs to make authenticated requests THEN the proxy service SHALL correctly forward authentication headers.
4. WHEN the proxy service is used THEN it SHALL support all content types currently supported (JSON, images, text).
5. WHEN the application is configured THEN it SHALL have a fallback mechanism if one proxy service is unavailable.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work seamlessly without noticing any proxy-related issues, so that I can use all features without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application THEN users SHALL NOT experience any CORS-related errors.
2. WHEN the application makes API requests THEN the response time SHALL be reasonable and comparable to the current implementation.
3. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL automatically select the best available proxy service.
4. IF a proxy request fails THEN the application SHALL attempt to use an alternative proxy service.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation on how the proxy solution works, so that I can maintain and troubleshoot it in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the solution THEN comprehensive documentation SHALL be provided.
2. WHEN documentation is created THEN it SHALL include information about the chosen proxy services.
3. WHEN documentation is created THEN it SHALL include fallback mechanisms and error handling strategies.
4. WHEN documentation is created THEN it SHALL include instructions for local development and testing.
